# Database Setup Instructions

## Issue: Missing dr_ahmed_news Table

If you're seeing errors like "relation 'public.dr_ahmed_news' does not exist", it means the database table hasn't been created in your Supabase project yet.

## Solution

You need to apply the database migration to create the required table. Here are two ways to do this:

### Option 1: Using Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20250708040435_restless_base.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI (if available)

If you have the Supabase CLI installed locally:

```bash
supabase migration up
```

## What the Migration Creates

The migration will create:

- `dr_ahmed_news` table with all required columns
- Proper indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Helper functions for updating timestamps and view counts

## Verification

After running the migration, you should see:

1. The `dr_ahmed_news` table in your Supabase Tables view
2. No more 404 errors in the browser console
3. The application working normally with database connectivity

## Fallback Behavior

If the database table doesn't exist, the application will:

- Display helpful error messages in the console
- Fall back to using localStorage for data storage
- Continue to function with sample data
- Show warnings about the missing database table

This ensures the application remains functional even without the database connection.
